# What's that?

<tt>egl</tt> is a [Go](http://golang.org) package for accessing the
[EGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_\(OpenGL\)) (Embedded Graphics
Library). EGL is the access door toward hardware accelerated graphics,
through OpenGL, on many embedded devices. The project was born for
accessing the GPU of the [Raspberry PI](http://raspberrypi.org) (check
this
[post](https://plus.google.com/u/0/100271912081202470197/posts/LQVYfrj49qA))
but now it has been generalized to be go installable on other
platforms too. This has the benefit that you could develop Open GL ES
2.0 applications on your desktop computer using
[Mesa](http://www.mesa3d.org/egl.html) and deploy them on embedded
systems like the Raspberry PI.

# Currently supported platform

* Raspberry PI
* Xorg

# Install

The package aims to be multiplatform. To achive this result two
approaches are used: [build
constraints](http://golang.org/pkg/go/build) and
per-platform/per-implementation initialization [boilerplate
code](platform/). By default egl will use the xorg implementation.

~~~bash
$ go get github.com/remogatto/egl # use xorg by default
~~~

To build egl against a particular implementation use the specific
build constraint, for example:

~~~bash
% go get github.com/remogatto/egl -tags="raspberry" # install on the raspberry
~~~

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples](examples/).

# To Do

* Add support for other platforms (e.g. android)
* Add tests
